    '''As a tech department, we're usually pretty good at spotting tech that's out of the ordinary. 
During time trials we're used to seeing new aero innovation, and while there are
certainly aero tricks used in road stages, they are harder to spot. A case in point,
throughout the Volta ao Algarve, Alexander Kristoff has been wearing an old discontinued time trial helmet,
complete with visor removed, in the road stages without anyone picking it up. 
He even won took home a bunch sprint beneath the lid.''';
